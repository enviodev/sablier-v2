# Overview

The Sablier V2 Envio Multi-chain Indexer indexes, organizes and aggregates data from the Sablier V2 smart contracts deployed across multiple EVM networks.

Currently the Sablier V2 contracts are deployed across 9 EVM mainnet networks, including Ethereum Mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Smart Chain, Base, Gnosis and Scroll.

The Sablier V2 Envio multi-chain Indexer is a modernized version of the current [Sablier Subgraphs](https://docs.sablier.com/api/subgraphs/overview), with added features such as:

- Multi-chain support allowing querying of data from the Sablier V2 smart contracts deployed across multiple networks with a single, unified API.

- Near real-time notifications of important events from Sablier V2 smart contracts using Envio actions.

<!-- TO DO : add hosted service link once deployed-->
The Sablier V2 Envio multi-chain Indexer is deployed on the Envio Hosted Service to query Sablier data using graphQL.
