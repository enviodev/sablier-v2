# Envio Actions

Envio actions adds support for receiving near-notifications if important events from Sablier V2 smart contracts.

In the demonstration below, notifications have been configured for 'cancel' and 'renounce' events for a given stream. 

This enables being notified when a lockup stream is cancelled or renounced.
